		<description>Energy is the amount of remaining power left this (An)droid got to use. If it is at zero the (An)droid will power down and die. It is naturally refilled by the Androids biological reactor through ingestion of food.\n\nCan also be recharged by using up consumable batteries and wearing certain clothing.\n\nIf no other options are available the (An)droid will seek out a nearby power source with connected batteries to fill up their energy reserves.</description>
